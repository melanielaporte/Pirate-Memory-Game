<h1 align="center">Pirate's Booty Memory Card Game</h1>

A small pirate-themed memory card game that tracks how many moves it takes for a player to complete the game. Designed to demonstrate interactivity and front-end coding skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Tech stack
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Challenges
I initially wanted the cards to be round coins, but encountered difficulties with object shapes in CSS. I pivoted by incorporating the coin motif into vintage-style cards, maintaining the theme while achieving a functional layout.

## Future Upgrades
- Multiple play levels
- Fireworks when the user completes the game
